 The Virtue of Sweetness
Just as eating and serving something sweet makes your taste buds feel sweetness, and for a while after, you remain happy,
 become sweet-natured yourself so that words filled with sweetness are constantly spoken. 
Such sweet words make both you and others happy. Use this method to always sweeten everyone's mouth; 
constantly maintain sweet vision, sweet words and sweet actions.

Happiness - The Purpose Of Our Existence

It is the art of living, the purpose of our existence. Happiness is the true index of quality of life. 
Without happiness, life is dry and meaningless. With happiness, life immediately becomes fulfilling and wonderful.
 Happiness is an infectious feeling that immediately lifts the sagging spirits of people. 
Happy people keep themselves happy because they know the little ways to appreciate themselves and to see the humour and magic in each moment.

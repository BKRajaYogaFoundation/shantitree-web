Love
Love is a powerful force. It can take us to great heights and leave us feeling light and airy. 
Yet it has been the most abused and misused force. Many degraded things pass for love. 
True love is based on understanding, mutual trust and respect and not simply on transient emotions. 
Love is being in balance, that is, in harmony with the self, God and each other. Love dwells in the soul. 
We must allow this love to flow out and around us. Without love, all of life's treasures are locked away from our vision and experiences, for indeed 'Love is the key.'

Honest Heart
An honest heart is an open heart. If we are dishonest in any way with ourselves or with others, it means we are in hiding. 
There is a wall, a barrier behind which we conceal something of ourselves.
 Subtle tension will be our companion, and while most of us learn to live with it, it drains our energy and tightens our muscles.
 On the other hand don't be too honest with others - feel their pulse - sometimes others are not ready to hear what's in your heart. 
But know that when you are honest you will experience a level of inner relaxation that you had forgotten was even possible.

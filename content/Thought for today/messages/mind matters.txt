Mind Matters

The most important part of you is your mind (not your brain - the brain is the hardware and the mind creates the software). 
Care for your mind, make friends with it, always feed it healthy food, engage it in positive activity, exercise it with knowledge and wisdom. 
Like a garden returns fragrance and beauty according to the care invested, so your mind will repay you with thoughts, 
ideas and visions of great beauty when tended and invested with care. Your mind is not made of matter but it does matter what you give it and what you create with it. 
Where your mind goes, you go. 
What your mind creates becomes your destiny.

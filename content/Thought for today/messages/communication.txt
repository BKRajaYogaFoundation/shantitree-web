Communication

The one who knows the art of connecting to others is successful. 
When someone is not behaving well, we tend to alter our attitude, response and behavior toward that person. 
We wait for the other person to chamge, befor e chamging ourselves. 
When I know the art of perceiving others' specialities and connecting to them, I will always be successful. 
I am then not dependent on the other person's behavior for my own growth.
 I am able to see each person's positive aspects and absorb them in myself too. Then I become richer with every interaction.

Be Quiet

Have you ever wondered why libraries have special atmospheres? They are places where many congregate but where silence is the code. 
Quietness in an atmosphere means there is the presence of quiet minds, and quiet minds are not only relaxed, 
they can concentrate easily and create more freely. Imagine you are in the library of your mind, 
browsing the accumulated wisdom on the shelves of your life - listen to the silence, be aware of the stillness. Now you can really listen. 
Now you can really hear. Now you can really think. Now you can create. And behold, you are an artist. Did you not know that silence and creativity are lovers?

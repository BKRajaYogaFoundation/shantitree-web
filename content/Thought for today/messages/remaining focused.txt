Remaining focused
Many of us have the tendency to postpone even the most important things to the last moment. 
We assume we will be able to get things done later. But sometimes the unexpected intervenes and everything collapses under the added strain.

When I remain focused I am able to prioritize. I understand that small tasks can be as important as the larger ones, 
and I make sure I get them done at the right time. I make sure I leave time for the unexpected, too.
 This lifts the pressure and allows me to give my best in every situation.

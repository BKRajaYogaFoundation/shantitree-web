Mindful Moments

Most of us are of sound mind, but many of us have trouble maintaining a note of harmony and peace. 
Most of us know how to think, but few of us are able to control our thoughts. 
We all have the capacity to be creative, to image new ideas, but few of us are able to do it together and co-create in harmony with each other. 
We could all do with some mental training so that we may use the most powerful energy in the universe, the mind, which is always at our instant disposal. 
We can begin with mindfulness. It's a simple way to gently help our mind go where it is best to go, do what is the best thing to do. 
It begins by simply being fully aware of what you are doing. Mostly we are not fully aware, as our minds wander into the past and then into possible futures. 
We spend most of our time watching others and so rarely fully focus on what we are actually doing ourselves. 
Next time you sit down to a meal, watch your self. Be aware of only what you are eating. 
Every time your mind wants to wander, bring it gently and lovingly back to the action and sensation of eating. 
Then do the same when cleaning, when writing, when working. The more you do it stronger and more focused and more rational will be your concentration, 
the more natural will be your actions, the more peaceful you will feel, and the more relaxed you will be, no matter what you are doing.

Words Words Words

Words! They are all around me! I see them. I use them. Harsh words, soothing words, biting words; words that give pain and sorrow; 
words that give joy and pleasure. They are vital to communication. When words are spoken there are reactions, negative or positive. 
Either thoughts are triggered or emotions fired or actions performed. Words colour our behaviour. 
And how lovely it is to hear words that are calm and free from rancour and aggression. 
To hear words that lift the soul and leave it with renewed vigour. Such words are the sparks of purity.
 It is important to remember that my speech indicates what is in my mind. As the thinking, so the words uttered. 
Mental calmness makes my words calm. A pure mind makes for pure words. It is said that speech may exalt someone to kingship or send him to the gallows.
 I should never let myself indulge in false, bitter and vicious speech.
 My words should reflect my true, inner nature, that of purity and peace. Words, once spoken, can never be recalled. 
They reverberate all around, beyond our control. Today, as I utter words, what effect will they have on those who hear them? 
Will they be the words that are poisonous and cause pain? Or will my tongue be like that of the nightingale, sweet and so, so very soothing and lovely to the ear?

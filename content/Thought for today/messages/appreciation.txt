Appreciation
Even if I don't mean to be critical, I often unconsciously focus on others' weaknesses and mistakes.
 The more I develop the habit of noticing goodness and only holding on to the good in others and in situations, 
the more my own sense of well-being will rise. When I continually think: 'He/She is wrong',
 I create a barrier that prevents me from reaching my own goodness.

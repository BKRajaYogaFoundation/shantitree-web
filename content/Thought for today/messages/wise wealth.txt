Wise Wealth
There are many words for which we have forgotten the meaning - love is one such word, and wealth is another. 
When we hear or use the word wealth today we immediately conjure images of huge cheques, large properties, five star holidays and the very best in everything. 
In fact it is this limited form of wealth, measured and defined essentially by money which blocks the realisation and manifestation of true wealth. 
Every human being is wealthy beyond imagination. But not in their bank accounts. Real wealth is completely intangible, invisible and deeply internal. 
Every human being is a unique individual spiritual entity. And as such, a source of the most precious energy in the universe. Love is the gold of the soul. 
We are each that gold at the core of our being. But few of us are aware of it, let alone consciously tapping it and expressing it. 
No one teaches us that love is what we are, that our purpose in life is to know it, and give it, 
and that when we do, all other energies, including the material stuff, will come back to us. 
We are taught instead that love is dead, love is daft, love is for softies, love is sex, loving is losing not winning, 
love is indulgence, love is about doing deals in our relationships. No wonder we are stressed out. 
We have a totally distorted view of wealth and an inherited belief system which clouds our view and access to the riches we contain within our heart. 
No wonder there is spiritual poverty amidst affluence, no wonder the destitute wander streets paved with the riches of their neighbours. 
No wonder the children in the villages of India have a smile that lights up your soul, 
while the kids in 'material land' are always miserable with their lot! Are you wealthy, or are you Wealthy?

Talking To The Self
When you talk to yourself in your mind, which self do you address? And how? Usually people do not talk to their divinity, 
but to the most superficial aspects of their everyday personality. And often its a stream of fears, complaints and mindless repetition of old things. 
If we talked that way to another human being, we would have to apologise. Learning to talk properly to the self is a spiritual endeavour.
 Thoughts from the past and worries about the future do not create good conversation. Instead learn to talk to your mind as if it were a child. 
Talk to it with love. If you just force a child to sit down, he won't. A good mother knows how to prompt her child into doing what she wants. 
Be a good mother to your mind, teach it good, positive thoughts so that when you tell it to sit quietly, it will. Love your mind. Stay happy.

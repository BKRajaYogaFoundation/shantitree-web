People are often unreasonable, self-centred: Forgive them anyway. 
If you are honest, people may cheat you, but be honest anyway. 
What you spend years to build, someone could destroy overnight. Build anyway. 
The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow. 
Do good anyway. You see, in the final analysis it is between you and God; it never was between you and them anyway.

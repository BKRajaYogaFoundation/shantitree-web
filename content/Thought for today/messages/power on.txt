Power On

Each day we all need to recharge our spiritual battery, otherwise the light of our consciousness becomes dim, 
thoughts become fuzzy, and decisions are impregnated with doubt. Power is available inside and outside.
 Inside us we have a spiritual centre, at the core of our consciousness, pure radiant spiritual light. 
This is what we are. However it is now blocked by our attachments, the record of all our life experiences and many learned beliefs and perceptions. 
Outside us we have the sun of spirit, the source, invisible to our physical eyes but only one second away when we are able to quieten and focus our mind. 
Meditation connects us to both sources of power - that's why meditation is the way to access the real vitamins and the minerals that spirit craves. 
The vitamin of pure love and the minerals of truth and wisdom. Take time to empower yourself today. 
Sit quietly and connect your mind to each source and allow yourself to recharge and renew.

Barriers to Love
Whatever is in your heart that is not clean, not true, will ultimately begin to act like a wall, obstructing the natural flow of love. 
People who say that there is no love in their life, are being blocked by this wall. 
Actually there is love, but they just can't accept it. Ego is the clearest example of this.
 Ego limits the flow of love by placing conditions on the love you give and receive. 
Ego uses love to satisfy its own needs and desires. It produces a love which is deceptive, one which brings only temporary satisfaction.
 Ego does not allow you to experience true love or share it. If fact, ego is capable of destroying your ability to feel love altogether.

86,400 Seconds
Imagine there is a bank that credits your account each morning with ?86,400. 
Every evening whatever part of the balance you fail to use during the day is deleted. 
What would you do? Draw out every cent and use it well, of course!!! Each of us has such a bank - Its name is TIME. 
Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds. Invest the day's deposits well, or the loss is yours. 
How could you bring the most contentment, happiness and benefit to yourself and others? The clock is running.

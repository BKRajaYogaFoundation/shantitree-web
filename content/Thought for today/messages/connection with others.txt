Connecting With Others

We are normally kind to people who are kind to us. But when someone is not behaving well, we tend to change our attitude, 
response and behaviour toward that person. We wait for the other person to change before changing ourselves. 
So we do not find change in others nor in ourselves.

When I see others’ inner qualities I connect to them more easily. I will not be dependent on another person’s behaviour for my own growth today. 
I will see each person’s positive aspects and take them within myself. In this way I will become richer with each interaction.

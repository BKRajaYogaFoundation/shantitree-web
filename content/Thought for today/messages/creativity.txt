Creativity

Acts of virtue emerge from deep within, from an inner sanctuary of silence from which inspiration flows. 
Every action has its seed in a thought and every thought is a creation of the thinker, the soul. 
I choose what thoughts I want to create and as is my thinking so are my actions and also my experience in life. Going within, 
I touch the stillness and pure love that lie at the core of my being and every thought that I create is of benefit to myself and of benefit to humanity.

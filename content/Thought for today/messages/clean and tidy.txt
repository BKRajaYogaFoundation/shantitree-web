Clean and Tidy

The most important places to keep clean and tidy are my mind and heart. 
If I allow thoughts to flourish that I wouldn't want to see the light of day, I can never have any real self-respect. 
By starting each day in quiet reflection and pouring positive, loving thoughts into my mind, I gradually clean out cynicism and unkindness.

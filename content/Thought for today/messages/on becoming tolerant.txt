On Becoming Tolerant

When someone disbelieves us, we usually argue back and try to prove our point. 
Yet we find that the more we talk, the less people listen. Unable to convince them, we end up frustrated. 

Instead, when someone challenges the truth of my words, I should think about whether they might be right. 
Rather than stubbornly clinging to my point of view, I could embrace this as an opportunity to learn. 
Even if I am correct in my thinking, if I become able to understand someone else's point of view without getting angry or refusing to listen, I become tolerant.

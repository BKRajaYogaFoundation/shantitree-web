Manage Emotions
When the energy of our consciousness is out of our control - the mind is agitated. We are being emotional. 
The solution is to detach from the inner storms, stand back and observe the hurricane pass. 
Detached observation withdraws the energy which your emotions require to sustain themselves.
 When you watch your own anger, it dies. If you don't detach from it, and observe it ...it will be your master.

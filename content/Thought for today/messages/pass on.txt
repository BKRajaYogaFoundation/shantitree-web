Pass On

Everything that comes to us, comes to pass or, more accurately, for us to pass on. Not just the money in our pocket, 
but wisdom, objects, ideas, even opportunities, all come to us, so that, at the right moment, we can pass them on. This is called flow. 
Being in the flow means being aware that the river of life is flowing to us at every moment. 
Being in the flow means accepting whatever comes and putting it to good use, before passing it on. 
Going with the flow means allowing whatever comes to move on freely, without holding on in any way. 
If we do not pass on, we are trying to block the flow, and that's when we feel pressure in our life. 
Pressure is always self-inflicted. Every time you feel 'under pressure' look at what you need to release and to pass on to someone else. 
Once you do you can ...relax...again.

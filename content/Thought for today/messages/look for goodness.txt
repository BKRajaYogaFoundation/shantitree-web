Look for Goodness
In everything, goodness is there. Our goal is to find it. In every person, the best is there. 
Our job is to recognise it. In every situation, the positive is there. Our opportunity is to see it. In every problem, the solution is there. 
Our responsibility is to provide it. In every setback, the success is there. Our adventure is to discover it. In every crisis, the reason is there.
 Our challenge is to understand it. By seeing the goodness, we'll be very enthusiastic and our lives will be richer.

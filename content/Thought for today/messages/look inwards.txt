Look Inwards
We all have three eyes. Two for looking out and one for looking in.
 Why would we want to look in when everything is happening 'out there'? Because the treasure we seek is inside, not outside. 
What is treasure? Beauty, truth, peace, happiness. You already have what you seek. You already are stunningly beautiful. 
You are already peaceful and loving. How come you don't know this? Simple, you never look inwards, 
beyond superficial memories or recent experiences, so you never see your own riches. 
Take a moment to stop, look in and see. Don't rush. Don't search. Just look. And be aware.
